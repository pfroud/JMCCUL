# JMCCUL
JMCCUL is a Java wrapper around the C API of the [Measurement Computing Corporation Universal Library](https://www.mccdaq.com/daq-software/universal-library.aspx).

MCC Universal Library is a library to communicate with MCC data acquisition hardware.

I am not affiliated with Measurement Computing Corporation.

## Existing UL APIs

On Windows, MCC offers UL APIs for C, C#, Visual Basic, and Visual Basic .NET, Python and Python.

You can compile UL for Linux and macOS.

There is an API for Android, but it uses `android.hardware.usb.*` stuff which we can't use on Java desktop.

## Getting started

Install UL.

The Universal Library puts `C:\Program Files (x86)\Measurement Computing\DAQ\` into the PATH environment variable.

## Limitations 

not tested very much

not everything implemented
